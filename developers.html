        <h2>Greg Kuchak</h2>
        <p>Greg once owned a Persian restaurant, however, after he was scammed out of it by his Iranian father, he was forced to work at Procucorp. There, he befriended Jack and Stan and, also, fell in love with Mary, but he will not admit it, even if he was held in Gitmo and the government threatened to cut of his balls.</p>
        <h2>Jack Bennett</h2>
        <p>Jack once had a great life with a wonderful wife. However, after she died at the hands of a drunk driver, he became depressed, turned into a teetotaler, and moved in with Stan.</p>
        <h2>Stan Wozniak</h2>
        <p>Stan is Polish, but you wouldn't know it because he seems more like trailer trash (because he is). Stan is somehow both the dumbest and the smartest of the bunch.</p>
        <h2>Mary Hirsch</h2>
        <p>Greg likes Mary, but she doesn't know it. Sometimes, she does things with the Guys but often gets ridiculed for it, so she doesn't do it that often.</p>
