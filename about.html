        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Tony Cross</h2>
        <p>Cross's career in show business began in third grade when he participated in a stage production of <i>Bye Bye Birdie</i> after being told that there weren't enough boys in the play (even after Cross joined, there still weren't enough boys in the play). Afterwards, Cross kind of forgot about show business until 2020, when he started coming up with ideas.</p>
        <h2>Armando Botiller</h2>
        <p>Botiller first encountered Cross in 2018 and since then, came up with ideas along with Cross.</p>
        <h2>Ethan Lawmaster</h2>
        <p>Lawmaster was first discovered by Cross in 2022 when Cross went too see <i>You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown</i>. Two months and several comparisons to John C. Reilly later, the two met when Cross got a job at Domino's (which sucked). Afterwars, Cross started randomly sending Lawmaster short clips featuring the <i>Developers</i> characters we all know and hate.</p>
